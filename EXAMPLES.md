## üéõÔ∏è Understanding Your Formatting Options

### Title Styles That Actually Make Sense

| Option         | Output                           | Best For                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `interview`    | `# Interview Transcript: [Name]` | Formal interviews, podcasts |
| `transcript`   | `# Transcript: [Name]`           | General documentation       |
| `conversation` | `# Conversation: [Name]`         | Casual chats, brainstorming |
| `meeting`      | `# Meeting Notes: [Name]`        | Business meetings, calls    |

### Speaker Header Styles

| Option | Output           | When to Use                        |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `h2`   | `## Speaker 1`   | Formal documents, clear separation |
| `h3`   | `### Speaker 1`  | Nested in other content            |
| `bold` | `**Speaker 1:**` | Inline dialogue, casual format     |

### Paragraph Length Control

**Length 2** (Short and punchy):

```markdown
## Speaker 1

Hello thank you for calling. How can I help you?

This is a new paragraph with the next sentences.
```

**Length 4** (Balanced and natural):

```markdown
## Speaker 1

Hello thank you for calling. How can I help you? This is continuing in the same paragraph. Here's another sentence to demonstrate the longer format.

Now this would be a new paragraph.
```

## üîß Advanced Scenarios You'll Actually Encounter

### Single Speaker Presentation

Perfect for recorded presentations, monologues, or solo podcast episodes:

```json
{
  "jobName": "presentation-q1-2024",
  "results": {
    "transcripts": [
      {
        "transcript": "Welcome everyone to our quarterly review. Today we'll be covering three main topics. First, our sales performance..."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

```

### Multi-Speaker Team Meeting

When you have three or more participants and need to track who said what:

```json
{
  "jobName": "team-standup-2024-01-15",
  "results": {
    "speaker_labels": {
      "segments": [
        { "speaker_label": "spk_0", "start_time": "0.0", "end_time": "10.5" },
        { "speaker_label": "spk_1", "start_time": "10.5", "end_time": "25.2" },
        { "speaker_label": "spk_2", "start_time": "25.2", "end_time": "40.1" },
        { "speaker_label": "spk_0", "start_time": "40.1", "end_time": "55.8" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Output with timestamps**:

```markdown
# Meeting Notes: Team Standup 2024 01 15

### Speaker 1 (0:00 - 0:10)

Good morning everyone. Let's start with our daily standup.

### Speaker 2 (0:10 - 0:25)

Yesterday I completed the user authentication module. Today I'm working on the dashboard.

### Speaker 3 (0:25 - 0:40)

I finished the database migration. No blockers for me today.

### Speaker 1 (0:40 - 0:55)

Great progress team. Let's reconvene tomorrow at the same time.

## üéØ Picking the Right Format for Your Situation

### Customer Support Calls

**Recommended**: Meeting format with timestamps

**Why**: You need to track timing for quality assurance, and the professional format works well for internal documentation.

### Interviews & Podcasts

**Recommended**: Default or detailed format

**Why**: Good balance of readability and useful metadata. The speaker-focused sections make it easy to follow the conversation flow.

### Business Meetings

**Recommended**: Meeting format with summary

**Why**: The executive summary with metrics helps busy stakeholders, and timestamps help reference specific decisions or action items.

### Casual Conversations

**Recommended**: Conversation or minimal format

**Why**: Natural dialogue feel without the overhead of formal structure. Perfect for brainstorming sessions or informal chats.

## üìä Performance & Quality Examples

### Large File Handling

For transcripts over 5MB with extensive speaker changes:

- **Processing time**: Usually 100-500ms (faster than you can blink)
- **Memory usage**: Optimized to work smoothly in any modern browser
- **Output quality**: Consistent formatting regardless of file complexity

### Complex Speaker Patterns

The app handles real-world messiness gracefully:

- **Rapid speaker changes**: Automatically merges consecutive segments from the same speaker
- **Overlapping timestamps**: Intelligent time range calculations prevent gaps
- **Missing data**: Graceful degradation when speaker labels or timing data is incomplete

## üöÄ Pro Tips for Best Results

### Before You Upload

1. **Check your JSON**: Make sure Amazon Transcribe completed successfully (status: "COMPLETED")
2. **Enable speaker identification**: Best results come from files with speaker labels enabled
3. **File size matters**: While we handle up to 10MB, smaller files process faster

### Choosing Your Format

1. **Match your audience**: Formal settings need professional formatting; casual contexts work better with minimal styles
2. **Consider your use case**: Will someone need to reference specific timestamps? Include them. Just need the gist? Go minimal.
3. **Test different options**: The live preview lets you experiment‚Äîuse it!

### Quality Assurance

1. **Review before downloading**: Check the preview for any formatting issues
2. **Verify speaker assignments**: Make sure the automatic speaker detection makes sense
3. **Test your markdown**: If you're using the output in specific software, test how it renders

The beauty of this tool is that you can experiment with different formats in real-time until you find exactly what works for your situation. Whether you're documenting customer feedback or creating podcast show notes, the right format is just a few clicks away!
