# üåê Ready-to-Deploy Files

If you're hosting this transcription converter or just want to peek under the hood, you've found the right directory‚Äîthis is where all the magic lives in production-ready form.

## What You'll Find Here

This directory contains everything needed to run the app on any static hosting service:

- **`index.html`** - The main application page where users upload and convert files
- **`css/style.css`** - Complete responsive styling (because nobody likes ugly interfaces)
- **`js/app.js`** - All the application logic and Amazon Transcribe parsing wizardry
- **`sample.json`** - Example Amazon Transcribe file for testing and demos
- **`.nojekyll`** - Tells GitHub Pages to serve files without Jekyll processing

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### GitHub Pages (Recommended)

The easiest path to get your converter live:

1. **Enable GitHub Pages** in your repository settings
2. **Select source**: Deploy from `main` branch `/public` folder
3. **Wait a minute** for GitHub to work its magic
4. **Visit your site**: `https://yourusername.github.io/transcription-to-markdown`

### Alternative Hosting

These files work anywhere static hosting is available:

- **Netlify**: Drag the `/public` folder to their deploy interface
- **Vercel**: Import your GitHub repo with zero configuration
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Connect your repository for automatic deployments
- **Any web server**: Upload these files to your domain's root directory

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development

Want to tinker with the code? Start the development server from the project root:

```bash
npm start
```

This serves files from this directory with automatic browser refreshing when you make changes (a developer's best friend).
